# HuffHuff

## A Huffman encoder/decoder script for compressing non-binary files.

This is my solution to the third of John Crickett's [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-huffman)

Run `poetry run pytest` or check out the encoding/decoding of playing cards in `/huffhuff`!

Here was a good resource for learning how to build the Huffman Coding Tree: [https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/CS3/html/Huffman.html](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/CS3/html/Huffman.html)
